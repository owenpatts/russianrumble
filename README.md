C# Rewrite of Slavic Squatters: Russian Rumble

Slavic Squatters: Russian Rumble is a Pokemon clone I originally wrote in Python back in highschool.  The original project had minimal structure, and was a 700 line runs-from-top-to-bottom .py file.  Embarrassing stuff, really.

Over the past couple weeks I've been slowly working in my free time on porting it over to C# using Microsoft's built-in graphics library.  It's not much as of yet, but I'll be continuing to work on it as time goes on.
